Akira’s story begins with two bots that left a lasting impression on me: [Eli] and [Yui]. For those of you who were around back then, you might remember these names. They weren’t just bots; they were staples in countless communities, bringing joy, utility, and a personal touch to Discord servers everywhere. But as with many great things, their time came to an end, and that’s where my journey with Akira truly began.

## The Rise and Fall of Eli

Eli was one of my favorite bots—a well-rounded and polished addition to any server. It had personality, features, and everything you could want. But, sadly, Eli’s life was cut short when the owner got banned. Suddenly, Eli was gone, leaving a massive gap in the Discord bot space. I, like many others, was left looking for alternatives, but nothing quite matched what Eli brought to the table.

## Discovering Yui

Not long after, I stumbled upon Yui. Yui quickly became my go-to bot, and I used it extensively in my own server and others. It wasn’t just a replacement for Eli; it had its own charm and features that made it stand out. Around the same time, I was learning how to code websites and began experimenting with making my own bot—a small project just for my server. That bot, though very simple, was the first version of Akira. She wasn’t much back then, just a basic bot for fun and utility, but it was a start.

## The End of Yui

Then came 2022. Unfortunately, Yui’s story ended too. The developer, understandably, didn’t have the time to manage such a large-scale bot, especially with Discord’s looming deadline for slash commands. Yui’s departure left another void. I tried looking for other bots that could capture the magic of Eli and Yui, but nothing seemed to click the same way.

## Building Akira

That’s when I decided: why not try my own take at it? I wanted to create a bot that could pay homage to what I loved about Eli and Yui while also bringing something fresh to the table. And so, in late 2022, Akira was born. Inspired by the best parts of those bots and fueled by my own vision, I set out to create something that could fill the void they left behind.

From the start, Akira was meant to be more than just another Discord bot. I wanted her to feel like a companion, someone users could rely on and connect with. I’ve been working on her ever since, constantly tweaking, improving, and expanding her capabilities.

## A Work in Progress

As of now, it’s almost 2025, and Akira is still in beta. Why? Because I don’t want her to just be good; I want her to be as close to perfect as possible. Creating a bot that truly lives up to the legacy of Eli and Yui isn’t an easy task, but it’s a labor of love. For me, Akira isn’t just about functionality; she’s a tribute to the bots that inspired me and a gift to those who, like me, miss what they brought to our servers.

## Looking Ahead

Akira’s journey is far from over. She’s still evolving, and I’m excited to see where this project will go. Whether you’re a fan of Eli and Yui or just looking for a bot that feels personal and unique, I hope Akira can bring a bit of that magic back to your server. Thank you to everyone who has supported her development so far; this is only the beginning!
