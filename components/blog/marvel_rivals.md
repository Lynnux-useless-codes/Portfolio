Marvel Rivals has finally launched, and I can see why many people are excited about it. It’s polished, it’s ambitious, and it has a roster of beloved characters. Yet, after spending some time with the game, I’ve realized it’s not a good fit for me. This isn’t about whether the game is good or bad—it’s simply a matter of personal preference and priorities.

Here’s why Marvel Rivals doesn’t resonate with me.

## 1. The Style Doesn’t Click with Me

One of the things that drew me to Overwatch 2 when I first started playing it was its art style. It’s vibrant, dynamic, and oozes personality. Even now, when I only play a few hours a week, I’m still drawn in by its unique aesthetic.

Marvel Rivals, though, doesn’t give me the same feeling. I can’t deny that it’s visually impressive, but there’s something about its art style that feels generic to me. Maybe it’s because Marvel’s characters are already so ingrained in popular culture that they don’t feel as fresh or exciting. Overwatch’s characters, by comparison, felt entirely new, and I think that’s why they left a stronger impression on me.

I understand that visual style is subjective, but for me, the design of a game is a huge factor in how much I enjoy it. Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals just didn’t click.

## 2. I’m a Casual Player, Not Competitive

If there’s one thing I can confidently say about myself as a gamer, it’s that I’m anything but competitive. I play games to unwind and have fun, not to stress over rankings or grind for the top spot. Overwatch 2 lets me do exactly that—I can jump into a quick match, enjoy the gameplay for a couple of hours, and walk away feeling satisfied, even if I didn’t win every match.

Marvel Rivals, on the other hand, feels much more focused on competitive play. While that’s great for people who love that kind of challenge, it’s not what I’m looking for. I don’t want to feel like I have to keep improving or keep up with a competitive meta. That’s not why I play games.

This casual approach to gaming is something I value deeply, and it’s one of the reasons why I just can’t see myself sticking with Marvel Rivals.

## 3. I’m Not Deeply Invested in Marvel’s Universe

Don’t get me wrong—I love Marvel movies and shows. Venom: The Last Dance was a great movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed series like Jessica Jones. But here’s the thing: my appreciation for Marvel doesn’t extend to gaming.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is vast and filled with characters, but it’s also overwhelming for me. While I enjoy bits and pieces of it, I’m not attached enough to the broader Marvel universe to want to spend time gaming in that world.

Overwatch, on the other hand, offered something different. Its characters were new and original `(~ish)`, and its story felt like a blank slate waiting to be explored. Even though Blizzard has had its fair share of missteps (more on that in a moment), the world of Overwatch still feels personal and unique to me. Marvel Rivals, by contrast, feels like an extension of a universe I already keep at arm’s length.

## 4. Live Service Games Are a Huge Commitment

This is probably the biggest reason why Marvel Rivals isn’t for me: it’s another live service game. And honestly, I’ve reached my limit with those.

Live service games demand a lot from players. You have to keep up with constant updates, new content, balance changes, and evolving storylines. That’s fine if you’re only playing one or two live service games—but anything more than that becomes overwhelming.

Now, you might be thinking, “If it’s too much, why not just drop Overwatch and play Marvel Rivals instead?” And honestly, I’ve considered that. But here’s the thing: even with all of its recent shortcomings, Overwatch 2 still gives me something that Marvel Rivals doesn’t.

I’ve spent years getting to know the world of Overwatch and its characters. Even though I only play a few hours a week now, those sessions feel like reconnecting with an old friend. I’ve built a connection to the game and its story, even if Blizzard hasn’t always delivered on their promises.

Marvel Rivals, on the other hand, feels like starting over. It’s not just the time commitment of learning a new game—it’s the lack of emotional attachment. For all its flaws, Overwatch still hooks me in a way that Marvel Rivals simply doesn’t.

So while I understand the argument to “just switch,” it’s not that simple for me. Live service games aren’t interchangeable—they’re deeply tied to the time, energy, and connection you’ve already invested in them.

## It’s Just Not My Game

At the end of the day, Marvel Rivals isn’t for me—and that’s okay. I can see why people are excited about it, and I hope the game succeeds for those who are invested.

For me, though, I’d rather stick to games that align with my casual playstyle and limited time. Marvel Rivals might be the perfect fit for others, but as someone who’s already balancing one live service game and a love for standalone stories, I know it’s not the right choice for me.
