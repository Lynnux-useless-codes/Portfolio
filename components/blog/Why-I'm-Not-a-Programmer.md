## Why I'm Not a Programmer (Even Tho I Can Code)

When people find out that I’ve dabbled in a decent number of coding languages, they often think I’m on my way to becoming some kind of tech wizard. But the truth is, while I know just enough to make things happen, I’m not looking to become a programmer—nor do I want to be!

### I Know Just Enough to Get By

Over the years, I’ve picked up the basics—or maybe less than the basics—of a few coding languages. There’s some Java (mostly from modding Minecraft because, let’s be honest, it’s fun to make things sparkly), JavaScript (and by extention TypeScript), Python, Bash, Shell, PowerShell, and even a little React. I’ve tinkered with HTML/CSS (with a hint of PHP), played around with Lua, and learned a bit of cURL (if you can even call that a language).

I’m not an expert in any of these, but I know just enough to create fun little projects, add some magic to my online spaces, or fix things when they go awry. Think of it as having a toolkit full of colorful coding tricks—perfect for when I want to bring a bit of creativity into my world, but not something I’m trying to turn into a career.

### My Projects Are Like Digital DIYs

For me, coding is like crafting with digital tools. I use it to make my life easier, add a dash of cuteness to my day, or just to see what I can create/do. Maybe Ill write a Python script to sort my playlists by mood, use React to build a mini-app that keeps track of my favorite anime, or add some JavaScript sparkles to a webpage. These projects aren’t meant for a portfolio or a client—they’re for fun, and for me! They're like DIY crafts, but with code.

### Not Looking to Join the Tech Squad

Even with all this tinkering, I’m not looking for a job in IT or as a software developer. I’m doing well on my current path, and the idea of coding 24/7 as a job just doesn’t suit me. I don’t want to turn something I enjoy into a chore. I’d much rather keep coding as a playful hobby—something I can dip into whenever I feel like it, with no pressure or deadlines.

### Learning for Fun, Not for Becoming a Code Ninja

I love learning new things, and coding is just one of the many skills I’ve decided to explore. But I’m not here to become a master coder or a tech expert. I’m more about keeping things small and light—learning enough to create the things I want without feeling like I have to go all-in. There’s so much freedom in being able to explore new interests without the stress of having to be the best at them!

### Coding for Cute, Not for Competence

To me, coding is like adding another pastel color to my creative palette. It’s a tool to make my digital world a little more adorable, solve small problems, or try out new ideas. I might whip up a Shell script to download from rule34, tweak a Lua script to make a game more fun and colorful, or use cURL to automate some of my web searches. It’s all about bringing more fun into my day, not about climbing any tech ladders!

### Conclusion: A Kawaii Coder Without a Career Plan

So yes, I know the basics—or less—of a decent number of coding languages, but I don’t see myself as a programmer. I’m definitely not looking for a job in IT or the programming world. I code because it’s fun, and because it helps me make my own little spaces on the internet, and because it’s a way to keep learning and having fun.
