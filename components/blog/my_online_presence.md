One question I get a lot is, “What’s up with your pronouns?” If you’ve seen my profile, you might have noticed I go by "any normative" pronouns. But what exactly does that mean? This blog post is here to explain what that term means for me, why I choose it, and how I see my online presence and identity.

In real life, like everyone else, I have a specific gender. That identity is part of who I am and affects how I interact with the world. But the internet is different. It’s a place where I choose to approach gender and pronouns in a more fluid, open way. Online, I’m not as concerned with being seen as strictly one thing or another—I think of myself as a digital presence, shaped more by ideas, connections, and experiences than by my physical identity.

## Why "Any Normative"?

So, let’s talk about “any normative” pronouns. For me, this means that I’m comfortable with people referring to me using any of the more common, socially recognized pronouns: he, she, or they. These are the pronouns most people are familiar with, and they’re what I consider “normative.” They’re standard enough that they fit within most people’s linguistic and social comfort zones.

When I say “any normative,” I mean you’re free to refer to me using whichever of these pronouns feels most natural to you. Maybe you get a “he” vibe from me, or maybe you think “she” sounds right. Maybe “they” feels like a better fit. Whatever you choose, it’s all fine by me. I like to keep things simple, open, and approachable. The common pronouns we’re used to are like a shared language—they keep interactions feeling comfortable for both sides.

## Why Not Other Pronouns?

You might wonder why I’m not open to using more unique or alternative pronouns, like “ze,” “xe,” or “hir.” I know these pronouns are meaningful to many people, and I respect that. But for me, they feel a bit off. I find them harder to connect with, and they don’t align with my approach to online identity. I also feel that, for most people, sticking to the more standard pronouns keeps things clearer and avoids misunderstandings.

I’ll admit that I even find alternative pronouns a little cringey for my own use. This isn’t a judgment on anyone who uses them—it's just a personal preference. I think of my online presence as a way to strip back the need for strict gender boundaries and labels, and normative pronouns keep things feeling relaxed and familiar.

## My Online Gender? "Whatever Works for You."

My approach to gender online is just as flexible as my pronoun choice. In my offline life, gender is a part of who I am. I have my own identity, shaped by my experiences and preferences. But online, I don’t feel tied to any one way of being seen. Think of it as a “whatever works for you” approach. If you read my messages and imagine I’m a guy, that’s totally fine. If you get the impression I’m a woman, that works too. Or maybe you see me as non-binary or something else altogether. Honestly, it’s all okay.

In a way, I like that people can see me differently depending on what makes them comfortable. It keeps things open-ended. Sometimes, people even joke that if I were a meme, I’d be the "attack helicopter" person (you know the one). While that’s just a humorous exaggeration, it kind of gets to the heart of my online identity: I don’t mind how you see me. I’m here to interact, learn, share ideas, and enjoy the digital space we share.

## Why This Approach?

At the end of the day, my online identity isn’t about labels or fixed pronouns. It’s about a shared space where we can connect without needing to pin each other down to any one perception. I use “any normative” as a way to keep things familiar but open. By sticking with standard pronouns, we all stay in a realm of shared understanding, where gender can take a back seat to the interactions we’re having.

So, if you’re ever interacting with me and wonder how you should address me—don’t stress about it. Use whatever normative pronoun feels right to you, and know that I’m totally okay with it. My online self is a flexible, open-ended persona that allows us to connect without the boundaries that gender sometimes imposes.

Whether you see me as “he,” “she,” or “they,” I’m just glad we’re here, sharing this space, making connections, and keeping things real—whatever that means in the virtual world.
