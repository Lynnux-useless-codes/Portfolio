# Free Websites for a Limited Time!

Hi there! I'm a hobbyist developer and part-time freelancer, and I’ve decided to do something fun:  

For the next **48 hours**, I’m offering to build **basic websites** for **free**! This is a no-strings-attached deal—just my way of practicing, helping others, and building my portfolio.  

---

## What to Expect  

I’ll create a **simple website** for you. Think of it as a great starting point—not a $400 custom professional site, but a functional and decent-looking one made with **Next.js**.  

You’ll get:  
- A basic site tailored to your needs (portfolio, small business, or personal blog).  
- The source code for free (so you can host it yourself if you’d like).  

If you’re okay with something **basic** and not super polished, this is perfect for you!

## Want Hosting Too?  

If you'd rather not deal with hosting, I can help! Here are your options:  
- **Subdomain + Hosting:** Host your site on `yourname.lynnux.xyz` for just **$4/month**.  
- **Custom Domain + Hosting:** Already have a custom domain? I’ll host your site for just **$3/month**.  

These options are totally optional—you’re welcome to take the code and host it yourself!  

---

## What's the Catch?  

No hidden fees, but I do have a small request:  
- If you like the site, please leave me a **testimonial** that I can showcase on my portfolio.  

It’s a win-win: You get a free site, and I get more experience and feedback!

## FAQs  

### **How long will it take?**  
I’ll confirm your request within 48 hours. Development may take a bit longer, depending on how many requests I get.  

### **Can I make revisions?**  
Sure, but within reason! These sites are free, so I may not have time for lots of changes.
