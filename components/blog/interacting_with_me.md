Living with multiple mental health conditions, including Bipolar II, ADHD, dyslexia, and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), has a significant influence on how I interact with others online. These diagnoses aren’t just labels—they each come with their own set of challenges that shape my energy, focus, and ability to engage with others. Since online interactions are often my primary way of connecting, I want to share how each of these conditions affects the way I communicate. My hope is that it will give you some insight into why my interactions might change or feel different at times.

## Bipolar II: The Rollercoaster of Highs and Lows

Bipolar II is characterized by cycles of mood changes, specifically between hypomanic and depressive episodes. Unlike Bipolar I, the hypomanic “highs” aren’t extreme, but they’re still noticeable in how I interact.

- ▪ **During hypomanic phases**, I’m often more energetic, talkative, and actively involved in conversations. I may respond quickly, take on multiple conversations, or feel motivated to participate in group activities. The world feels more vibrant, and my social energy is at its peak.

- ▪ **In depressive phases**, however, things shift significantly. The energy I had before seems to drain, and even small social interactions can feel overwhelming. It’s not that I don’t want to engage, but tasks like replying to messages or keeping up with conversations require more effort. I might become quieter, slower to respond, or need breaks to recharge.

These mood shifts are part of the natural cycle of Bipolar II. If you notice that I’m super engaged one day and then distant the next, it’s often because of where I am in that cycle. My communication style is directly tied to these phases, so I appreciate understanding when I’m in a quieter or more withdrawn mood.

## ADHD and ADD: Focus, Consistency, and Bursts of Energy

Having both ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and ADD (Attention-Deficit Disorder) creates a unique set of challenges in terms of attention and energy. With ADHD, I can experience intense focus but also sudden shifts in interest, while ADD can make it hard to stay engaged in a single activity for extended periods.

- ▪ **ADHD brings bursts of hyperfocus** where I dive deeply into conversations or projects. I can be very responsive, creative, and full of energy during these periods. But just as quickly, my focus might shift, making it hard to stay on the same topic. This can lead to messages that jump around or occasional gaps in my replies as my mind races in multiple directions.

- ▪ **ADD, on the other hand**, can make focus and consistency a challenge. While ADHD brings energy, ADD can cause mental “fog” or distraction. This makes it tough to keep up with conversations that require sustained focus or have lots of details. Sometimes I’ll get distracted midway or need extra time to catch up on missed parts of a conversation.

Together, ADHD and ADD mean that my presence online can feel inconsistent. If I seem scattered, forgetful, or lose track of a conversation, it’s likely because my attention is pulled in multiple directions. This is not a lack of interest but rather the way my brain naturally functions.

## Dyslexia: A Different Way of Processing Language

Dyslexia affects the way I process written language, impacting my ability to read and write quickly. In online spaces where most communication is text-based, dyslexia adds an extra layer of difficulty.

- ▪ **Reading and responding to messages** can take me longer than most people, as I often have to reread things to make sure I’ve understood them. Long blocks of text can be overwhelming, and I may need breaks to keep my focus. I rely on tools like spell-checkers and grammar helpers, but typos or unusual phrasing may still pop up, especially if I’m replying quickly.

- ▪ **Complex language or subtle nuances** can be harder for me to pick up on, and if I misinterpret something, it’s usually unintentional. Dyslexia makes it harder to detect certain social cues that others may express in text. If I miss something or respond in a way that seems unusual, please know it’s just part of how I process language—it’s not a reflection of my interest or intent.

This means that sometimes my responses might seem slower, more literal, or slightly less polished than others. It’s simply part of the way my brain handles language, and while I do my best to adapt, it’s not always perfect.

## Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): How Seasons Affect My Mood

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that’s directly tied to changes in seasons, especially during the darker, colder months of winter.

- ▪ **Winter brings a noticeable shift in my energy and mood**. When daylight decreases, so does my motivation and overall mental energy. This seasonal change often affects my presence online—I might become less active, feel more withdrawn, or need to prioritize self-care over social interactions.

- ▪ **Interactions may feel “heavier” for me**, and it’s not uncommon for me to take breaks or limit my online time in the winter months. SAD makes it difficult to stay as engaged as I’d like, even with people I care about, simply because the lack of sunlight impacts my mental health. If I seem more distant or quiet during this time, it’s simply because I’m focusing on managing these seasonal effects.

SAD is something I work through each year with techniques like light therapy and structured routines, but even with coping strategies, the change in seasons can still affect my ability to stay connected online.

## Why My Online Presence Can Feel Inconsistent

These conditions each have their own unique impact, and together, they create a layered experience that can make my online presence feel unpredictable. Some days, I’m fully engaged and ready to chat, while on other days, I might need time to recharge or struggle to keep up with conversations.

I share this not for sympathy but for understanding. Each interaction is influenced by these mental health conditions, and they play a big role in how I connect, communicate, and sometimes withdraw. If I seem distant, inconsistent, or if my tone changes unexpectedly, it’s rarely personal. I’m simply navigating my own mental health journey, and I appreciate the patience and understanding of those who engage with me online.

Thank you for taking the time to understand what’s going on behind the screen. It means a lot to me, and your understanding helps make online spaces feel a bit more welcoming, quirks and all.
