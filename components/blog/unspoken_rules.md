If you’ve ever wondered, “How do I best interact with this person?” you’re not alone! I thought I’d save us all some time by laying out the unspoken rules for interacting with me online. Think of this as a casual guide to avoid any awkward moments and to keep things fun and easygoing between us.

## 1. Respect My Boundaries—Casual Vibes Only

- ▪ **What It Means:** I’m here to enjoy this online space, not get too intense. I’m not one for deep or overly serious conversations unless we’re already close or it’s really necessary. Keep things friendly and relaxed, and we’ll get along just fine.

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** Just because it’s easy to DM doesn’t mean I’m available 24/7 for deep dives into anything heavy. If you’re ever in doubt, think casual vibes first!

## 2. Don’t Overthink My Responses (Or Lack Thereof)

- ▪ **What It Means:** If I respond with a short message or even take my time replying, it doesn’t mean I’m not interested. It’s just part of how I communicate.

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** Sometimes, I get distracted or simply need a little time to reply. Taking things slow is often just my way of making sure my responses are thoughtful rather than rushed.

## 3. Memes Over Small Talk

- ▪ **What It Means:** If you’re going to send a message out of the blue, I’d probably rather it be a funny meme or an interesting link than a “Hey, what’s up?”

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** Humor is a big part of how I like to connect online. I’d much rather skip the small talk and get right to the good stuff—whether that’s laughing over a meme or chatting about something fun.

## 4. Use Normative Pronouns—Don’t Worry About Getting It Right

- ▪ **What It Means:** Use any normative pronoun (he/she/they) for me. I’m not picky about which you choose, so use whatever feels natural to you.

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** This is my way of keeping things easy and low-pressure for everyone. Online, I don’t mind how people perceive my gender, so don’t overthink it!

## 5. Joking and Sarcasm Are Welcome—But Not All the Time

- ▪ **What It Means:** I love a good joke and a little sarcasm, but balance is key. Knowing when to throw in some humor and when to dial it back can make our conversations more enjoyable.

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** Online, tone can sometimes get tricky, so if we keep things balanced, it makes for a smoother interaction. Bring on the laughs, but let’s keep it friendly and light.

## 6. Avoid Sensitive Topics Unless We’re Close

- ▪ **What It Means:** I’m all for open conversations, but I’d rather steer clear of sensitive or overly personal topics unless we have a good level of trust.

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** I want to keep online interactions positive and low-stress. Bringing up big, heavy subjects can feel like a lot to handle over text, so if we avoid them, we’re likely to have an easier time connecting.

## 7. Assume I’m Busy Unless I Say Otherwise

- ▪ **What It Means:** I’ve got a lot going on behind the screen, so if I don’t reply right away or miss a message, it’s nothing personal!

- ▪ **Why It Matters:** I prefer to keep online interactions relaxed. If we assume everyone’s busy and juggling life outside the internet, it keeps expectations realistic.

## Final Thoughts

Interacting online doesn’t have to be complicated, but a little awareness goes a long way! These "unspoken rules" are here to help make things easier for everyone involved. So, let’s keep it light, have a laugh, and enjoy connecting without any unnecessary drama. Thanks for reading—and here’s to keeping things easy and enjoyable in the digital space!
